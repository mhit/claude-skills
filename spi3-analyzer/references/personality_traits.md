### Japanese Workplace Cultural Values

- **チームワーク** (Teamwork): Group harmony
- **サポート** (Support): Helping others
- **着実遂行** (Persistence): "Gambaru" spirit

**Less Valued (May Create Friction):**
- Very high 独自性 (too individualistic)
- Very high 批判性 (too negative)
- Very high 自己尊重性 (doesn't respect hierarchy)
- Very low 従順性 (challenges authority)
- Very high 懐疑思考性 (doesn't trust)

### Adaptation Considerations

When evaluating candidates with:
- **High 独自性** + High 自己尊重性 + Low 従順性: May struggle in traditional Japanese firms; better for startups or foreign companies
- **Very low 関係構築**: May struggle with "nominication" culture (after-work socializing)
- **High 批判性**: May be valued in consulting/foreign firms; less so in harmony-focused organizations

### Generational Shifts

Younger generations show:
- Higher 独自性 (individuality)
- Lower 従順性 (less hierarchical)
- Higher 自己尊重性 (more assertive)

Modern Japanese companies increasingly value these traits, but traditional firms still prefer conventional profiles.

## Interpretation Tips

### 1. Consider Trait Combinations, Not Isolated Scores
- Single trait rarely tells full story
- Look for patterns and combinations
- Warning combinations are critical

### 2. Context Matters
- Same trait can be strength or weakness depending on role
- Company culture affects trait value
- Team dynamics influence fit

### 3. Extreme Scores (70+ or 30-) Usually Indicate Risk
- Even "positive" traits become problems at extremes
- Balance is often better than extremes
- Investigate extremes carefully

### 4. Japanese Cultural Lens
- Interpret through cultural expectations
- "Maverick" traits valued less than in West
- Group harmony trumps individual excellence

### 5. Use Traits to Predict Challenges, Not Just Strengths
- Every strength can become weakness
- Anticipate situational difficulties
- Plan mitigation strategies
